# TeachingSuite

This program, written in VB (.net), runs under Windows and under Wine (Linux, Mac).

The purpose of the program is to take as much burden off a teacher as possible so the teacher can focus on teaching rather than on administrative necessities.

The program was initially created in 2011 and receives regular updates and enhancements as the main developer is, himself, a teacher and uses this application daily.
